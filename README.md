# imdb_scraper

This script will gather IMDB ratings for each episode in a TV show, and write the results to a csv file.

## Getting started

Run from the command line using the name of the show that you want the ratings for, removing any spaces from the title. For example:

```
python imdb_scraper.py gameofthrones
```

The csv file will take the name of the show.
