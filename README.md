# imdb_scraper

This script will gather IMDB ratings for each episode in a TV show, and write the results to a csv file.

## Getting started

Make sure that the chromedriver is in the same folder as the script. Run the script from the command line with the name of the show as an argument, removing any spaces from the title. For example:

```
python imdb_scraper.py gameofthrones
```

The csv file will take the name of the show.
